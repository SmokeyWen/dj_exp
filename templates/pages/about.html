          <h2>Painkey, Paint with Smokey</h2>
          <p class="lead">I might have discovered what framework I like the most.</p>
          <br>
          <!-- <img src="{% static 'img/about.jpg' %}" alt=""> -->
          <p>Painkey is a Django project that I decided to work on while staying at home and doing job searching. Due to the pandemic, job searching was incredibly more difficult for people like me who graduated from colleges before it happened. In order to keep myself busy and hopefully pick up a few new skills, I started to read through Django ducoments and online tutorials.</p>
          <p>I really like to work with Python - easy to read and understand. After some time for a memory refresh on Python syntax, I started this Django project. Django gives me a brand new way of thinking on planning and designing the structure of a web application. As I was working on this project, new ideas kept popping up in my mind and I will continuously work on Painkey to make it more presentable.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="lead">What Happens Next?</p>
          <p>There are still flaws in this web application, on both front end and back end. I will take my time to fix them and hopefully refactor and organize its file system to make it easier for me to add more features in the future. Below are some of the ones already on my mind:</p>
          <li>Comment section below each miniature </li>
          <li>Like counter for each miniature page</li>
          <li>To-do list for both this website and the miniatures I own but haven't been painted</li>

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi, this is Wen. From two years of intense study in BCIT, I built web applications with various frameworks and technologies for PC and mobile platform. </p>
          <p>One major project was requested by BCIT Student Association that can showcase all the events across campuses and allow new students to reserve and redeem points for prizes after attending the events. It was built with NodeJS, Express and MySQL. The project before Painkey was a cross-platform mobile application that connects sports clubs and athletes. Club managers/atheletes can view each other's card depending on their identities and like or dislike by swiping right and left. Then both parties can be connected when they both like each other. React Native was used for creating the front end, Express and MySQL was for the back end accosiated with AWS EC2 service.  </p>
          <p><strong>If you are interested in my background and would like to know more about my previous projects, feel free to reach out to me via <a href = "mailto: 835033838wen@gmail.com" style="background-color: white; color: #2b6cd4;">email</a>.</strong></p>
